# virtualization

this is a technology that refers to creating multiple virtual machines that share the hardware resources of a physical server.

the key concept here is separating software from hardware by converting 'physical devices' to 'logical folders' or files.

virtualization is the fundamental technology that powers cloud computing.

it transforms physical hardware into virtual resources.

then cloud will deliver this virtual resources on-demand

## main features of virtualization

1. partitioning - a physical server can partition itself into multiple virtual  servers
2. isolation -  this physical server can isolate these virtual servers to act as independent virtual servers
3. encapsulation - these virtual servers are encapsulated into files, which can be cut/copied and pasted elsewhere just as you do in files
4. independence - these virtual servers when moved/migrated into another server, can easily run, it should be platform independent

## hypervisor

this allows multiple virtual servers to run on the same physical server

each vm has its own os
