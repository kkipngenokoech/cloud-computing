The cloud acts as a de facto standard for delivering software services these days. It reduces logistics friction and makes it easier for service providers and consumers.

The sheer scale and computing power of cloud platforms have made it easier to stream audio and video services over the Internet, providing consumers with a great experience. By using technologies such as content delivery networks, cloud vendors have reduced the latency of delivering content to end users. Netflix, Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Prime, etc., have become household names, and we would be hard-pressed to consume media in any other format these days.
