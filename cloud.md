# CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services, such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more, over the Internet ("the cloud"). This offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

The cloud computing model is a paradigm shift from the traditional computing model, where businesses need to procure the hardware, maintain, secure, and upgrade it to keep their services up and running. With the cloud computing model, operational complexity shifts from organizations to cloud vendors who operate cloud platforms. Businesses focus on delivering customer value rather than being bogged down by operational concerns.

## cloud computing deployment models

Cloud deployment model refers to the way in which cloud computing services are provided and managed over the internet

they include:

1. Public cloud
2. Hybrid cloud
3. Private cloud
4. Community cloud
5. Multi-cloud

### public

Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers who deliver computing resources, such as storage, computing, etc., over the Internet. With this model, cloud service providers can provide a massive capacity of resources to run workloads for many customers in a shared model. We can think of this as a utility provider such as electricity. Consumers get connections over the shared infrastructure
