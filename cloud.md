# CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services, such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more, over the Internet ("the cloud"). This offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

The cloud computing model is a paradigm shift from the traditional computing model, where businesses need to procure the hardware, maintain, secure, and upgrade it to keep their services up and running. With the cloud computing model, operational complexity shifts from organizations to cloud vendors who operate cloud platforms. Businesses focus on delivering customer value rather than being bogged down by operational concerns.
